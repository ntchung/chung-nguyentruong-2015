### Programmer reflection
##### No coding IDE?
Without a specialized Code Editor, it could be quite a challenge to program bigger games. While using Intel XDK that already supports Phaser or Pixi SJ is very convenient and fast to develop with, it is a challenge to get GC Devkit works with any popular HTML5 Code Editor. I am currently using Brackets to code, but only benefit from the syntax highlights and very basic coding aids. It would be nice to have an IDE fully working with GC Devkit.
